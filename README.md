### This is the place for developers to collaberate on the use of open source shuup/shuup. This repo is only the front page, it has no code.  A repo will be maintained here configured to deploy to Digital Ocean App Platform.  Working repo will be kept up to date with shuup/shuup and include additional modules for payments and shipping.  for now the shuup_stripe and my own custom shipping modeles are included. 

Discussions can take place [HERE](https://github.com/openshuup/openshuup/discussions)
